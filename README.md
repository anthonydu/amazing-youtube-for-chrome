# Amazing YouTube for Chrome

This extension simplifies YouTube's user interface by removing various components that I consider to be eyesores and useless while also adding additional nice-to-have functionalities using CSS. Works with YouTube's latest UI (signed in) as of the most recent update date.

## List of UI elements removed

### Across YouTube

- Scrollbar
- Shorts, Originals, YouTube Music, Your clips, and Your videos buttons from the sidebar
- Subscriptions, More from YouTube sections from the sidebar
- Voice search and create button from the header

### Home page

- Suggested filters below the header
- All shelves in home page suggestions (Shorts, etc.)

### Watch page

- Annotation
- Suggested filters above the up next column
- Text labels from buttons in the video details section (side effect: flexible items that were usually hidden will now have space to show up, i.e. download and save)
- Clip and super thanks buttons removed from video details section

## Added functionalities

- Theater mode player will always be 16:9 (off by default)
- Replaces mini-player button with picture-in-picture (which YouTube has built-in but does not display for some reason)
