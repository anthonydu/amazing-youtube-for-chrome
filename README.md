# Amazing YouTube for Chrome

This extension simplifies YouTube's user interface by
removing various components that I consider to be eyesores and
useless while also adding additional nice-to-have functionalities using CSS.
Works with YouTube's latest UI (signed in) as of the most recent update date.

## Latest Updates

Since blocking of in-stream ads is no longer allowed on YouTube,
suggestions feed ad blocking feature has been added this extension
in case ad blockers only allow whitelisting of entire domains.
I would personally suggest using this extension with
[YouMute](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bhlmjoeobnofoajffmnpcahfaffihmbh)
or [Autoskip for Youtubeâ„¢ Ads](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hmbnhhcgiecenbbkgdoaoafjpeaboine)
for the most amazing YouTube experience.
